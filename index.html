			<h2>What is Mystery Shopper?</h2>
			<ul class = "move">
			<li>1. Mystery Shopper is a service that allows companies to recruit customers to collect information on how effective their employees are at there job.</li>
			<li>2. The customer gets sent in to collect information by filling out texboxes and collecting timings. The app tries to make it as simple as possible to complete.</li>
			<li>3. One of the most important aspects about this service is that the customer who is going in to evaluate must stay unknown and anonymous at all times. If the employee finds out that they are being evaluated this could lead to them putting on a front and not being themselves.</li>
